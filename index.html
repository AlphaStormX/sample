                <p class="text-justify">Space exploration has come a long way since the early days of space travel. In the past few decades, technological advancements have made it possible for humans to explore deeper into the cosmos, uncovering the mysteries of distant planets and celestial bodies. With missions like the Mars Rover and the James Webb Space Telescope, we are learning more about space than ever before.</p>
                
                <h2>Why Space Exploration Matters</h2>
                <p>Space exploration is not just about discovering new planets or moons. It has the potential to solve many of Earth's most pressing challenges. For example, by studying how life might exist in extreme conditions on other planets, scientists could learn new ways to improve sustainability on Earth.</p>
